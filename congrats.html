			the feat you just accomplished.</p>

			<p>And yet you carry the Golden Orb of Galf&mdash;no longer a legend, but proved by your
			expedition to be a real artifact. Surely it will lead to many conversations in both
			scholarly and popular circles. Or maybe you'll just use it to turn invisible and shoot
			magic lasers from your eyes. In any case, your friend's twenty bucks will soon be in
			your pocket.<p>

			<p>You searched where others passed by. You persisted where others gave up. And you found
			value where others saw nothing.</p>

			<p>Whatever you do with the Orb, what you gained in Flagstone stays with you.<p>
